# `Deep_RL_agents`

This project contains the code and relevant material for the implementation of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning
algorithms for single and multi-agent learning in both discrete and continuous action spaces. All implementations use
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) as RL framework, and leverage two simulation API's:

- **OpenAI gym**: Python API facilitating implementation and research on deep learning algorithms (click [here](https://gym.openai.com/) for more info)
- **Unity ML-agents**: Advanced simulation framework leveraging game environments for ML agent training and research (click [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) for more info)

---

The project contains 4 implementations of different algorithms across different environments.
